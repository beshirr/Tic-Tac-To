# Tic-Tac-Toe
The basic Tic-Tac-Toe game we all know, but with a little bit of variation.
# What's different?
Insted of using (x, o), players will be using numbers to play the game, 
each player will choose to play with either odd or even numbers.
The first person to complete a line that adds up to 15 is the winner. 
The line can have both odd and even numbers.
# Note
This game was originally made for a college assignment, If you have any suggestion to develop or improve the game, I'd be so glad to hear your opinion.
